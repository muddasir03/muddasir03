<p>
I'm Muddasar, a Full Stack Engineer specializing in production-grade SaaS infrastructure and AI-driven automation for startups and scaling businesses.

I architect backend-heavy systems using MERN and Ruby on Rails, with deep expertise in deploying AI agents that automate mission-critical operations, customer support, lead qualification, internal workflows, QA, and decision pipelines, all engineered for reliability, scalability, observability, and cost efficiency.

Core Expertise:

⚙️ Backend & Full-Stack (Node.js, Ruby on Rails, React/Next.js) – Scalable SaaS platforms with clean architecture, domain-driven design, and production-ready frontends</br>
💳 API Development & Integration – Extensive experience building and integrating RESTful and GraphQL APIs, including third-party services such as Stripe and Twilio</br>
🧠 AI Agents & Automation – Production-ready workflows with state management, guardrails, and human-in-the-loop controls</br>
🐳 DevOps & Tools – Proficient in Git, GitHub, GitLab, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jira, ensuring smooth CI/CD processes and efficient project management</br>
☁️ Cloud Infrastructure – AWS-native systems (ECS, Lambda, RDS), Docker, CI/CD, cost-optimized deployments</br>

I partner with teams that value engineering rigor, long-term scalability, and measurable business impact. Whether you're launching a SaaS product, modernizing legacy infrastructure, or embedding AI agents into operational workflows, I deliver solutions that perform under pressure.

📩 Open to collaboration, consulting, and high-impact engineering engagements.
